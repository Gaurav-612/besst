        <label for="acc1">What is a BESS(Battery Energy Storage System)?</label>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="inner">
                A BESS is a battery that stores energy, detects outages and automatically becomes your home's
                energy
                source when the grid goes down or during on-peak hours.

        <div class="content">
            <div class="inner">
                A BESS charges and stores power during low and med-peak hours and then it discharges and becomes
                the
                home's power source during on-peak hours.

        <label for="acc3">Why is energy storage important?</label>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="inner">
                Energy storage fundamentally improves the way we generate, deliver, and consume electricity. It
                not
                only helps during emergencies like power outages from storms, equipment failures or accidents
                but
                also considered as a game-changing nature of energy storage due to its ability to balance power
                supply and demand, which makes power networks more resilient, efficient, and cleaner than ever
                before.

        <input type="checkbox" name="trg1" id="acc4">
        <label for="acc4">Can energy storage technology work with all fuel sources? How?</label>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="inner">
                Yes, energy storage systems are “fuel neutral.” Whether electricity is generated from oil, gas,
                coal, nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal, or other sources, energy storage captures excess
                electricity
                at high efficiencies for optimal use during outages, peak hours, or whenever effective grid
                management is a challenge.

        <!-- 5th menu -->
        <input type="checkbox" name="trg1" id="acc5">
        <label for="acc5">How will energy storage cut power costs?</label>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="inner">
                Energy storage can lead to cost savings in two primary ways. The first is by lowering the
                overall
                cost of providing electricity. The second is by allowing customers to avoid premium pricing (or
                “peak demand”). Industry insiders call this saving money on “both sides of the electric meter.”
                But
                broader energy storage deployment can save consumers money in additional ways. Shorter outages
                for
                residents after a storm or an equipment failure can help save not only money but lives. And
                fewer
                outages overall lead to less economic losses.

        <!-- 6th menu -->
        <input type="checkbox" name="trg1" id="acc6">
        <label for="acc6">Is energy storage technology safe?</label>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="inner">
                Yes. Energy storage has been a part of our electricity grid since the 1930s. In fact, energy
                storage
                makes up approximately 2% of US generation capacity and enjoys a safety record that is similar
                or
                better than other electricity generation, distribution, or management methods.

        <!-- 7th menu -->
        <input type="checkbox" name="trg1" id="acc7">
        <label for="acc7">What is peak-shaving? How does energy storage fit in?</label>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="inner">
                During times of peak electricity demand like when air conditioners ramp up on hot days - many
                utilities charge customers extra since they have to ramp up expensive additional electricity
                production to meet the demand. These charges are called “time-of-use” or “peak” prices since they
                are tied solely to when a customer uses the electricity.
                Energy storage works in similar ways, but since energy storage lets customers decide when to buy and
                when to use the power, a customer is freed from premium charges, increasing cost savings.

         <label for="acc10"> How does the powerwall actually cause GHG emission reduction?</label>
         <div class="content">
             <div class="inner">
                Similar to the idea of cost-savings, throughout the day - GHG emissions will vary across the grid based on the source of production (solar, nuclear, gas, etc.). If a household were to store electricity during a period of lower GHG emission and then discharge that stored electricity during a higher GHG emission period - then some GHG emission are ‘shaved’ off because electricity from the grid was not used during this time period.

        <label for="acc11"> Why should I choose BESST?</label>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="inner">
                BESST aims to reduce the amount of steps required from the user and make it easy for the user to use. With accordance to the user's electricity bill, BESST reduce the burden of users having to research & understand their usage. Additionally, by using the tesla powerwall as the product reference, the number of inputs for a user are reduced as well (mainly battery storage specifications). BESST essentially trade-off flexibility of the tool for simplification of the user interaction.
